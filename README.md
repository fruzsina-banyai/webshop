# Webshop

## Work in progress
This project is currently in development. So far, I've successfully implemented the User Management Service, Product Catalog, and Shopping Cart functionalities. Looking ahead, my next goal is to advance the project to a stage where I can begin working on a user interface that seamlessly integrates with the existing backend.

### Objective of the Website 
The primary aim of the website is to establish a user-friendly and secure online shopping platform. Its adaptable nature allows for customization, catering to the distinct needs and preferences of each customer. Whether personalizing the shopping experience or ensuring a seamless transaction process, the website is designed to deliver a user-centric and flexible webshop environment.

### [User Management Service](https://github.com/fruzsina-banyai/webshop/blob/main/documentation/user_management_service/user_management_service.md)
As a user, I aim to monitor my orders and revisit information about my previous purchases. Achieving this involves establishing a user management service.

### [Product Catalog](https://github.com/fruzsina-banyai/webshop/blob/main/documentation/product_catalog/product_catalog.md)
For users, navigating the product catalog is an essential feature. Effortlessly locate products by category, price range, or relevant criteria, ensuring a user-friendly and efficient shopping process. On the administrative side, the ability to modify, organize, and customize the product range provides control and flexibility, presenting a dynamic and appealing catalog.

### [Shopping Cart](https://github.com/fruzsina-banyai/webshop/blob/main/documentation/shopping_cart/shopping_cart.md)
The shopping cart feature should not only collect various products chosen to be purchased but also displays selected items, quantities, and prices. This element simplifies the decision-making process, aiding users in finalizing their selections before proceeding to checkout.

### Customization
The customization feature adds an extra layer of personalization to the user experience. If available, users can tailor selected products to their liking, ensuring a unique and tailored purchase aligned with individual preferences.

### Checkout
After the user is done filling up their shopping cart, they can proceed to checkout. This secure page collects vital order information such as shipping and billing addresses, preferred shipping options, payment details, packaging preferences, and any applicable coupons. This detailed and user-friendly checkout process is designed to make transactions smoother and improve user satisfaction.

### Secure Payment Processing
Opting for online payment directs users to a secure payment processing site. Here, users can input their payment information, assured that the website employs the needed security measures. Securing and processing payments without any breaches is a crucial element of a safe online shopping experience.

### Order Tracking
User account management includes the integration of order tracking. Users receive timely updates on the status of their orders. From confirmation to shipping and delivery, this feature adds transparency, keeping them informed every step of the way.
